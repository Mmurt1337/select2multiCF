Plugin for implementation of JIRA multiselect and single select list fields
with aui select2 look and feel (like fix Version's field) by implementing new
customfield types:

"Select 2 single CF"
"Select 2 multi CF"

Field are using standard searcher for select list fields

For field to became accessible by SIL scripts it's necessary to set
Option[] -> string[] and Option -> string mapping for "Select 2 multi CF" and
"Select 2 single CF" respectively in "AddOns - Cprime Plugins Configuration - Custom
Field Mapping"

Known issues: field are not visible by SIL life fields.
