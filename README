Plugin for implementation of JIRA multiselect and single select list fields
with aui select2 look and feel (like fix Version's field) by implementing new
customfield types, inherited from standard multiselect and single select but
with custom vm templates and js resources:

"select-2-single-cf"
"select-2-multi-cf"

Field are using standard searcher for select list fields

For field to became accessible by SIL scripts it's necessary to set
Option[] -> string[] and Option -> string mapping for "Select 2 multi CF" and
"Select 2 single CF" respectively in "AddOns - CPrime Plugins Configuration -
Custom Field Mapping"

Known issues: to be operable by SIL LF hide, show, disable enable functions
it's necessary to call with SIL the simple js-files calling to functions:
 - disableField(key); - to disable field;
 - unDisableField(key); - to enable field;
 - hideField(key); - to hide field;
 - showField(key); - to show field;
